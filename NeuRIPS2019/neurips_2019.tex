\begin{abstract}
    The goal of this project is to build a News Recommender System. We chose to work on a News Recommender system since we were interested in addressing both the dimensionality (associated with large text content) and recommendation problems that were covered in class. Among the different domains of recommender systems, news recommendation has been explored relatively less due to the lack of structured data and features. Text mining for news articles using NLP techniques in itself is a different class of problem. In this project we aim to build a pipeline for extracting user and news article features, and eventually build a hybrid recommender system to address the problems of cold start, data sparcity and scalability.
